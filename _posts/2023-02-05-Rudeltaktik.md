# Features

- This map based on `U-Boat`.
- The reason why I select this map is inspired by a match between `iloveoov` with `Yellow`.
- Original map type is Island. I focused to remain it and made easier to get natural.
- All Start Location's entrances are blocked by `Door Sprites`. **Only workers** can pass through using minerals. There are **0 amount minerals** so you can go up or down.
- For zerg players, There are Vespene geysers covered by two `Khaydarin Crystal`. **Only zerg** can build extractor. Distance between geyser with StartLocation is `4 tiles`.
- 12 half, 4, 6 half, 10 o'clock natural is your frontyard (Counter clockwisely). Their entrances's length is `8 tiles`. Be aware, the other side natural is widely open.
