- The reason why I select this map is that when I met starcraft, I played melee with computer on this map. This map make nostalgic feeling to me.

  I remained it and focused on standard fight meta.

- 3/9 o'clock natural can be blocked.
- `A Creep Colony` is placed behind 4/10 nat. It covered by `Khaydarin Crystal`, you cannot destroy it without splash damage.
