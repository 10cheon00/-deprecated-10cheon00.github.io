# Features

- This map based on `Challenger`, one of original map.
- The reason why I select this map is that when I met starcraft, I played melee with computer on this map. This map make nostalgic feeling to me.
- Main feature of this map is the battle in the fully flat ground and fierce battle in every place.
  I remained it and focused on standard fight meta.
- Frontyard entrance length is `8 tiles` and fully blockable.
- 3/9 nat's bridge can be blocked by 3 pylons.
- This map fully compatible in 1.16.1.
